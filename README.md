## Step 1: How to Setup

**1:** git clone this repo

**2:** cd to the cloned repo

**3:** Install the Application with `yarn`

**Extra step for IOS:** npx pod-install ios

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of React Native project. Run the following command to start _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

- run `yarn android`

### For iOS

- run `yarn ios`

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
